							<p><h2>Movie rate & review analysis with web-scraping</h2>
							
							<center><p><b>Full code available <a href="https://github.com/DSpeanut/Projects/blob/main/Rotten%20tomatoes%20movie%20analysis.ipynb"> here </a></b></center></p>
							
							<p>The main goal of this project is to scrape data from the <a href = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/>Rotten Tomatoes website</a> and conduct data analysis and visualization. 
							<a href = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/?year=2021>The target webpage</a> includes the top 100 movies for each year with movie ratings and the number of reviews.</p>
							<p><i>The analysis result may not represent the entire movie trend because of the limitation of the dataset(100 movies per year), and data may change due to frequent changes in Rotten Tomatoes pages.</i></p>
							<p>With this project, I would like to explore and find the answers to the below questions:
							<br/>
							<ol><li>Which movie was the most reviewed for the past 10 years?</li>
							<li>Which movie was the most rated for the past 10 years?</li></ol><hr /></p>

							<h2><u>Part 1</u> Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
							
							<p> &nbsp;The Rotten Tomatoes posts the top 100 movies every year on <a href= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/?year=2021>their website.</a> 
								I wanted to scrape this webpage and explore the data to find some interesting insights. 
								By using python packages Urllib and Beautifulsoup, the webpage was successfully scraped and 
								parsed. The scraped data includes movie ratings, titles, and the number of reviews for 2021.</p>

								<p><center><span class="image"><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/image3.png" alt="" /></center>
									<center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 1.</b> Top 10 movies for 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>
									
								<p>&nbsp;Figure 1 shows the top 10 movies for 2021 rated by the rotten tomatoes. The best movie of 2021 was <b>Nomadland</b>.
								However, This ranking table is sorted by neither the number of reviews nor ratings. 
								The ranking is based on <u>adjusted scores</u> which is a weighted formula(Bayesian) designed by the Rotten Tomatoes.</p>
								<p>Now, Let's explore which movie is most reviewed and rated for 2021.</p>
								
								<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/most_reviewd_2021.png" alt="" />
									<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/most_reviewed_chart.png" alt="" /></center></div>
								<p><center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 2.</b> 10 most reviewed movies for 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>
								<p>&nbsp;The movies were sorted with their number of reviews in descending order, now we can see that <b>Dune</b> was the most reviewed movie for 2021 with 450 reviews 
									followed by <b>Black Widow</b>(438) and <b>Nomadland</b>(420). 
									Although Dune is the most reviewed movie, its rating seems pretty low at only 83%. 
									This is probably the reason why Dune is only ranked at 42nd on the top 100 movies chart and we can assume not many users liked the movie.


								<p><center><span class="image"><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/most_rated_table.png" alt="" /></center>
										<center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 3.</b> 10 Most rated movies for 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>
										
								<p>&nbsp; I wanted to check which movie was top-rated, however, the top 10 high-rated movies have all 100% ratings! 
									Despite the small number of reviewers, they must have loved these movies. 
									Unfortunately, this result doesn't provide useful information so let's find the lowest-rated movie.</p>
								<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/least_rated_table.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/least_rated_chart.png" alt="" /></center></div>
								<p><center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 4.</b> The least rated 10 movies for 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>
								<p>&nbsp; It turns out <b>Black Widow</b> was the lowest-rated movie among the top 100! Interestingly <b>Dune</b> has ranked as the second-lowest.
								 Both <b>Black Widow</b> and <b>Dune</b> were ranked very high on 'Most reviewed movies' chart, but did not show on top 10 movie chart. 
								Given this result, we can assume people made many reviews on these two movies but they also rated these movies very low at the same time. 
								Some people must be a bit disappointed. </p>

							<h2><u>Part 2</u> Movie analysis from 2012 to 2021</h2>

							<p>After looking at the 2021 movie data, I wanted to explore more on what movies were loved for the past 10 years.</p>
							
							<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_table.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_reviews_trendline.png" alt="" /></center></div>
							<p><center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 5.</b> The total number of reviews for top 100 movies from 2012 to 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>

							<br/>
							<p>&nbsp; During 10 years, approximately 16,000 reviews were made for top 100 movies every year. 
							The figure 4 line-graph(right) illustrates how the number of reviews have been chaning over the 10 years. 
							Starting from 2015, the number of reviews increased rapidly until it reachs a peak in 2018 and decreases significantly. 
							The dataset doesn't have much information about what cause this phenomenon, 
							but we can assume few reasons as following: Decrease in movie release and cinema customers due to COVID 19, Appearance of competitors and others.</p>


							<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_rate_table.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_average_rate.png" alt="" /></center></div>
							<p><center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 6.</b> The average rating for top 100 movies from 2012 to 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>

							<br/>
							<p>&nbsp; The ratings of top 100 movies remained steadily around 90% ~ 94% over the ten years. 
								The average of rating for top 100 movies was 93.50%.</p>
								
								&nbsp; Now, we can get back to our initial question.
							
							<b>"Which movie was most reviewed for the past 10 years?"</b>

							<p><center><span class="image"><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_mostreviewed_table.png" alt="" /></center>
								<center><figcaption><font size = "3"><br/><b>Figure 7.</b> The top 10 most reviewed movies from 2012 to 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>
							<p>&nbsp; Among 1,000 movies, <b>Once Upon a Time In Hollywood(2019)</b> was the most reviewed one between 2012 to 2021 !</p>
							<p>&nbsp; Now we can move on to our second question: <b>"Which movie was the most rated one for the past 10 years?"</b> </p><br/>

							<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_highrate_table.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_lowrate_table.png" alt="" /></center></div>
							<p><center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 8.</b> The top 10 most/least rated movies from 2012 to 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>
							
							<p>&nbsp; Figure 8(left) table shows the most rated movies list. 
								However, all the top-rated movies were rated as 100% which is an expected situation considering the 2021 rate analysis. 
								Instead, let's take a look at the least rated movies in figure 8(right). 
								As we can see the movie <b>Brave</b> and <b>The Revenant</b> were selected as the least favourite movies at 78% rating.</p>
							<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_most_reviewed.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_lowestrate_chart.png" alt="" /></center></div>

<br/>




<center><b><font size = "10"> CONCLUSION </font></b></center>

<p>&nbsp; By conducting exploratory data analysis on the data, we found the most reviewed movie for the past 10 years:<b> Once Upon a Time In Hollywood(2019)</b>.
On the other hand, the most rated movie for the past 10 years was not a single choice since there were many movies rated as 100%. Alternatively, I found the least rated movie for the past 10 years: <b>Brave(2012)</b> and <b>The Revenant(2015)</b>.
