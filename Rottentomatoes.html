							<h1>Rotten Tomatoes Movie Analysis</h1>

							<p><h2>Movie rate & review analysis with web-scraping</h2>
							
							<center><p><b>Full code available <a href="https://github.com/DSpeanut/Projects/blob/main/Rotten%20tomatoes%20movie%20analysis.ipynb"> here </a></b></center></p>
							
							<p>The main goal of this project is to scrape data from <a href = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/>Rotton Tomatoes website</a> and conduct movie data analysis. 
							<a href = https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/?year=2021>The target webpage</a> includes the top 100 movies for each year with movie ratings and the number of reviews.
							*Due to the limitation of the dataset(100 per year), the result may not represent the entire movie trend.</p>
							<p>
							From this analysis, I would like to explore and find the answers to below questions:
							<br/>
							<ol><li>Which movie was most reviewed for the past 10 years?</li>
							<li>Which movie was most rated for the past 10 years?</li></ol><hr /></p>

							<h2><u>Part 1</u> Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
							
							
							<p> Rotten Tomatoes posts the top 100 movies every year on <a href= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/top/bestofrt/?year=2021>their website.</a> 
								I wanted to scrape this webpage and explore the data to find some interesting insights. 
								By using python packages 1) Urllib and 2) Beautifulsoup, the webpage was successfully scrapped and 
								the data includes movie ratings, titles, and the number of reviews for 2021.</p>

								<p><center><span class="image"><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/image3.png" alt="" /></center>
									<center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 1.</b> Top 10 movies for 2021 on Rotten Tomatoes</figcaption></font></center></p>
									
								<p> Figure 1 shows the top 10 movies for 2021 from Rotten Tomatoes. The best movie of 2021 is <b>Nomadland</b>
								However, This ranking table is sorted by neither the number of reviews nor ratings. 
								The ranking is based on adjusted scores which is a weighted formula(Bayesian) designed by Rotten Tomatoes. <br/>
								Now, Let's explore which movie is most reviewed and rated for 2021.</p>
								
								<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/most_reviewd_2021.png" alt="" />
									<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/most_reviewed_chart.png" alt="" /></center></div>
								<p><center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 2.</b> 10 most reviewed movies out of top 100 for 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>
								<p>By sorting the movies with their number of reviews, now we can see that <b>Dune</b> was the most reviewed movie for 2021 with 450 reviews 
									followed by <b>Black Widow</b>(438) and <b>Nomadland</b>(420). Although Dune is the most reviewed movie, its rating seems pretty low at only 83%. This is probably the reason why Dune is only ranked at 42nd on the top 100 chart.


								<p><center><span class="image"><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/most_rated_table.png" alt="" /></center>
										<center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 3.</b> 10 Most rated movies out of top 100 for 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>
										
								<p>The top 10 high-rated movies have all 100% ratings! Despite the small number of reviewers, 
										they must have loved these movies. However, this result doesn't provide much useful information. 
										Let's find the lowest-rated movie.</p>
								<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/least_rated_table.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/least_rated_chart.png" alt="" /></center></div>
								<p><center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 4.</b> The least rated 10 movies out of top 100 for 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>
								<p><b>Black Widow</b> is the lowest-rated movie among the top 100 movies! and <b>Dune</b> has ranked as the second-lowest.
								Interestingly, both <b>Black Widow</b> and <b>Dune</b> were ranked very high on 'Most reviewed movies' chart, but not on top 10 movies. 
								Given this result, we can assume people made many reviews on these movies but gave very small rating at the same time. 
								They must be very disappointed. </p>

							<h2><u>Part 2</u> Movie analysis from 2012 to 2021</h2>

							<p>2021 data has some interesting fact, and now I would like to explore more what movies were loved and hated for the past 10 years.</p>
							
							<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_table.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_reviews_trendline.png" alt="" /></center></div>
							<p><center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 5.</b> The total number of reviews for top 100 movies from 2012 to 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>

							<br/>
							<p>During 10 years, approximately 16,000 reviews were made on average. 
							The figure 4 line-graph(right) illustrates how the number of reviews have been chaning over the 10 years. 
							Starting from 2015, the number of reviews increased rapidly until it reachs a peak in 2018 and decreases significantly. 
							The dataset doesn't have much information for reason of this hugh drop, 
							but we can assume few reasons: COVID 19, Appearance of competitors etc.</p>


							<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_rate_table.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_average_rate.png" alt="" /></center></div>
							<p><center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 6.</b> The average rating for top 100 movies from 2012 to 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>

							<br/>
							<p>The average ratings of top 100 movies each year remain steadily through the years. 
								The average of rating for top 100 movies is 93.50%.<br/>
								
							Now, we can get back to our initial question.
							
							<b>"Which movie was most reviewed for the past 10 years?"</b>  The answer is found below.</p><br/>

							<p><center><span class="image"><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_mostreviewed_table.png" alt="" /></center>
								<center><figcaption><font size = "3"><br/><b>Figure 7.</b> The top 10 most reviewed movies from 2012 to 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>
							<p><b>Once Upon a Time In Hollywood(2019)</b> was the most reviewed movie out 1,000 movies between 2012 to 2021. Our second question was <b>"Which movie was most rated for the past 10 years?"</b> </p><br/>

							<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_highrate_table.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_lowrate_table.png" alt="" /></center></div>
							<p><center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 8.</b> The top 10 most/least rated movies from 2012 to 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>
							
							<p>Figure 8(left) table shows the most rated movies list. However, all the top rated movies are same as 100% which is expected. 
								Instead, let's take a look at the least rated movie on the right table. 
								As we can see from Figure 8(right), the movie <b>Brave</b> and <b>The Revenant</b> were selected as the least favorite movie at 78% rating.</p>
							<div class = "figure"><center><img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_most_reviewed.png" alt="" />
								<img src="images/Rotten tomatoes/tenyears_lowestrate_chart.png" alt="" /></center></div>

								<p><center><figcaption><font size = "3"><b>Figure 9.</b> The top 10 most/least rated movies from 2012 to 2021</figcaption></font></center></p>

<br/>




<center><b><font size = "10"> CONCLUSION </font></b></center>

<p>By conducting expolatory data analysis on the data, we found the most reviewed movie for the past 10 years:<b> Once Upon a Time In Hollywood(2019)</b>.
On the other hand, the most rated movie for the past 10 years was not a single choice since there were many movies rated as 100%. Alternatively, I found the least rated movie for the past 10 years: <b>Brave(2012)</b> and <b>The Revenant</b>.
</p><br/>

<b>* Please note this result is only based on Top 100 movies from 2012 to 2021. </b>
